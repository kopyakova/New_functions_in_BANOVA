New_functions_in_BANOVA is a repository, which showcases the new functions developed in my thesis: "Mediation and Moderation Analyses with the BANOVA R-package and Everything You Need to Know to Do it Right". 

Note that these functions are only for display purposes. To see them in action the whole package should be installed from CRAN in a usual manner.

Each folder includes the R code of the new function and corresponding files with documentation.
